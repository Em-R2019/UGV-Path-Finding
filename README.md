Run with:
`python Commander.py N t T x y True/False`

Example:
`python Commander.py 20 100 150 6 7 True`

I wasn't sure whether the whole map should increase value over time or just the visited planes, so the whole map value increase can be toggled with the True/False command.
When using a small grid the code will plot a detailed grid with the final values of the planes, the closed/open planes and the path. When larger grids are used a simplified grid is plotted with only the path.
